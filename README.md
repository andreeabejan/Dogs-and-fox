# Dogs-and-fox
I created this project in the first year of University, for the Introduction to Programming seminar. The game can be found in the second chapter of Nicolae Oprisiu's book, "Olimpiada Jocurilor Nationale".

To play the game, you need an 8x8 square board (chessboard), four white pawns and one black pawn (instead of pawns, you can use tokens, coins, buttons, etc.). In my project, I used pictures for the dogs and the fox. 

One of the players will play as "dogs" - the four white pieces, and the other will play as the "fox" - the black piece. Both the "fox" and the "dogs" can only move one step to a neighboring square on the diagonal if it is free. In other words, all pieces will only move to black squares, at any time during the game. But during the game, the fox can make an extra step in any direction, while the dogs can only move forward, from the 1st row to the 8th row, without being able to move back. 

The idea of the game, suggested by its name, is the pursuit of the fox by the dogs. If the fox manages to reach the first row of the board (instead of the dogs' initial position), it has escaped the pursuit and won the game. When the fox is surrounded by the dogs and can no longer move in any direction, it has lost the game.
